\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
\pagenumbering{arabic}


\begin{itemize}
\item Initial input: Independent series of clock and comb data
\begin{itemize}
	\item Clock shift files containing variables: MJD, shift, and possibly ISGOOD 
	\item Frequency comb data containing variables: MJD, SDR:frep ErYb, fo ErYb, fb Si ErYb, fb Al ErYb, fb Yb ErYb
\end{itemize}
\item Read data into Python
\item Define functions to find optical frequencies for each clock with comb equation, these frequencies will become additional variables in the frequency comb data object 
\item compute total correction for each clock's shift data 
\item Data processing 
\begin{itemize}
	\item change all data variables to type float for high precision computing
	\item find overlapping MJD values for each clock frequency data set 
	\item visualize gaps in the clock frequency data sets 
	\item decide upon initial and final MJD values for analysis  
\end{itemize} 
\item Imputation -  decide how to deal with missing shift values
\begin{itemize}
	\item adjust start/end MJD indices for large gaps of missing values 
	\item use interpolation techniques (see below) for short sequence of individual missing values 
	\item keep with caution about how this may impact subsequent steps 
\end{itemize}
\item Interpolation - to get clock data to match up with comb time intervals, key difference from imputation step is data is contained w/in a certain range of start/stop MJD values 
\begin{itemize}
	\item numpy.interp, linear 
	\item pandas.interpolate, linear 
\end{itemize}
\item Calculate clock frequencies by adding together comb frequencies and shift data, scaled by the total correction amount 
\item End results: clock ratio data to compare offset to previous measurements (may contain missing values?) 
\end{itemize}

%   When referring to references in the text parenthetically,

%	“Reference [1] . . .” is the correct form).
