@ARTICLE{galleani2010, %not applicable b.c does not analyze the case of interpolation or mapping low frequency series to match a different high frequency series, instead considers use of kalman filter to correct/fill in low frequence series w/ a more accurate, higher frequency series (so series are comparable)
