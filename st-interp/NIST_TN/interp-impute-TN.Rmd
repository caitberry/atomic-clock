\section{Introduction}

relevant TS properties 

- type of missingness - random (MCAR (e.g. sensor failure), MAR, NMAR), structural deficiency

- trend(s) - autocorrelation plot slowly decreases as the lag increases; Cox-Stuart Test

- seasonality - factors of fixed, known frequencies; autocorrelation plot has larger values for the multiples of the seasonal frequency; Autocorrelation Testing of a certain order 

- noise type

  * white - little/no autocorrelation, stationary TS; autocorrelation plot w/ approx $95\%$ of the spikes within an interval of $\pm 1.96/\sqrt{T}$, where $T$ is the length of the time series; Autocorrelation Testing (i.e. the autocorrelation of the signal must be different from zero only for order zero)

  * flicker/pink

\section{Data Preparation}

Initial input: Independent series of clock and comb data
\begin{itemize}
	\item Clock shift files containing variables: MJD, shift, and possibly ISGOOD 
	\item Frequency comb data containing variables: MJD, SDR:frep ErYb, fo ErYb, fb Si ErYb, fb Al ErYb, fb Yb ErYb
\end{itemize}

 Read data into Python

 Define functions to find optical frequencies for each clock with comb equation, these frequencies will become additional variables in the frequency comb data object 

 compute total correction for each clock's shift data 

 Data processing 
\begin{itemize}
	\item change all data variables to type float for high precision computing
	\item find overlapping MJD values for each clock frequency data set 
	\item visualize gaps in the clock frequency data sets 
\end{itemize} 

\section{Missing Data}

Identify large gaps vs individual or small sequences of missing values of shift data.  

Identify possible/likely causes of missingness 

\begin{itemize}
	\item note MJD indices for large gaps of missing values 
	\item use interpolation techniques (see below) for short sequence of individual missing values 
	\item keep with caution about how this may impact subsequent steps
  \item decide upon initial and final MJD values for analysis  
\end{itemize}


\section{Frequency Alignment}

AFTER data is processed, deciding how to handle missing values, THEN address the likely issue of differences in frequency of observations with interpolation techniques. 

Interpolation - to get clock data to match up with comb time intervals, key difference from imputation step is data is contained w/in a certain range of start/stop MJD values 

\begin{itemize}
	\item numpy.interp and pandas.interpolate, linear 
	\item other options: incorporate randomness, kalman smoothing
  \item lit review 
    \begin{itemize}
    \item including (but not limited to) the problem of transforming a low-frequency series into a high-frequency one
      \begin{itemize}
      \item A Survey of Methods to Interpolate, Distribute and  Extrapolate Time Series (2010) https://www.scirp.org/html/3396.html - Kalman filtering Sec. 6 
      \end{itemize}
    \item 
    \end{itemize} 
\end{itemize}



\section{Summary and Next Steps}\label{sec:summary}

Calculate clock frequencies by adding together comb frequencies and shift data, scaled by the total correction amount 

End results: clock ratio data to compute offset to compare to previous measurements (may contain missing values?)
